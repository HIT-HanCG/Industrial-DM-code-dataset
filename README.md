# 🏭 Industrial Data Matrix (DM) Code Dataset

This repository contains a collection of **industrial-grade Data Matrix (DM) code datasets**, gathered from real-world production environments in multiple industries, including:

- 📦 **Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacturing**
- ⚙️ **Wheel manufacturing**
- 🔧 **Electronic assembly & SMT (Surface Mount Technology)**

---

## 📖 Overview

The **Data Matrix (DM) code** is a two-dimensional barcode widely used in industrial production for **product traceability, quality control, and manufacturing process tracking**.

This dataset is built to support research and application development in **industrial machine vision**, particularly focusing on **DM code detection, localization, and decoding** under various challenging conditions such as:

- Lighting variation and glare  
- Dirty or scratched surfaces  
- Low contrast or motion blur  
- Different materials and printing methods
